0 ramp .01
0.1 step 0.35
0.101 ramp 0.01
0.2 step 0.35

(used above repeating till t=1; 
first step ramp contour of streamlines from 0.01 to 0.35, then step back to 0.01)

0 step 1
0.1 step 0 
0.2 step 1
0.3 step 0

(use above on visibility of clip1) do inverse on visibility of other clip (or shrink like I used)

camera
just pick the positions and it will interpolate between them
